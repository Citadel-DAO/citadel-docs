2. Head to the [CTDL-WETH LP Bond page of the Citadel website](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds/ohm_weth_lp). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of CTDL-WETH LP tokens you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of CTDL you can purchase.

# Migrate Tokens (v1.1)

To prepare the roll-out of [Citadel v1.1](https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-v1-1-a5c6a48be7d1), the staking contract has been upgraded. Users need to migrate their staked CTDL from the old contract to the new one in order to keep receiving rebase rewards.

## How to Migrate Your Staked CTDL

1. Go to the [Migrate page of the CitadelDAO website](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/stake/migrate).
2. In **Staked \(Legacy\)** field, you can see your staked CTDL balance in the old contract. Click "Unstake SCTDL \(Legacy\)" to unstake all of them. If this is your first time to unstake CTDL, you need to approve the contract to spend your sCTDL token.

3. After the unstaking transaction has completed, you are now in the second stage of the migration process: restake CTDL in the new contract. **Refresh the browser** to make sure your CTDL balance show up correctly on the input field.

4. Approve the contract to spend your CTDL token and wait for the transaction to complete.
5. Click "Stake CTDL \(New\)" to restake your CTDL in the new contract and wait for the transaction to complete.
6. Congratulations! You have now completed the migration process. The **Staked \(New\)** field should show your staked CTDL balance in the new contract. If it does not show the balance correctly, refresh the browser.

## Tokens

### gCTDL

gCTDL stands for Governance CTDL. gCTDL is wrapped sCTDL, which allows you to use sCTDL on different blockchains. It is priced exactly the same as wsCTDL:

$$
gCTDL_{price} = CTDL_{price} * CurrentIndex
$$

You still collect rebase rewards just as if you had sCTDL, but you won't see your token balance increase because the increase in value is based on the Current Index at the time of purchase and sale. [See this FAQ](../basics/basics.md#how-do-i-track-my-rebase-rewards) for more details.

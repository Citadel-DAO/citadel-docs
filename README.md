# Introduction

## What is Citadel?

Citadel is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the CTDL token. Each CTDL token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI) in the Citadel treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Citadel also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding. Read more about the game theory aspect of Citadel in one of our blog posts.

## What is the point of Citadel?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the CTDL token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that CTDL can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.

## How do I participate in Citadel?

There are two main strategies for market participants: [staking](basics/staking.md) and [bonding](basics/bonding.md). Stakers stake their CTDL tokens in return for more CTDL tokens, while bonders provide LP or DAI tokens in exchange for discounted CTDL tokens after a fixed vesting period.

Governance participants can get involved on our forum and through discussions on our community discord and DAO discord servers respectively. We are always looking for new community members to contribute!

## How can I benefit from Citadel?

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new CTDL tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in CTDL and thus the bonder's profit would depend on CTDL price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static CTDL price.

## Who runs Citadel?

No one. Citadel is DAO-governed. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by token holders through snapshot voting.

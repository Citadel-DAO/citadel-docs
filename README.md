## What is Citadel?

Citadel is a "Treasury DAO" using the decentralized protocol forked from Olympus DAO. Citadel DAO uses the CTDL token and each CTDL token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI) in the Citadel treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Citadel uses economic and game-theoretic dynamics into a market through staking and bonding.

## What is the point of Citadel?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the CTDL token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. The system is optimized to create growth and wealth creation in the short term, while bringing assets to the DAO that can be leveraged in the long term to fund the next level of "BTC on DeFi".

## How do I participate in Citadel DAO?

There are two main strategies for market participants: [staking](basics/staking.md) and [bonding](basics/bonding.md). Stakers stake their CTDL tokens in return for more CTDL tokens, while bonders provide LP or other assets in exchange for discounted CTDL tokens after a fixed vesting period.

Governance participants can get involved through discussions on our community discord. Community members are encouraged to contribute!

## How can I benefit from Citadel?

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new CTDL tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in CTDL and thus the bonder's profit would depend on CTDL price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static CTDL price.

## Who runs Citadel?

No one. Citadel is DAO-governed. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by token holders through snapshot voting.

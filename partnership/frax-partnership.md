# Frax Finance

A [new partnership between CitadelDAO and Frax Finance](https://olympusdao.medium.com/ohm-x-frax-a-new-breed-of-partnership-95cd1cc01770) has been announced on 10 June 2021. This partnership allows CitadelDAO to accumulate CTDL-FRAX liquidity through the sales of bonds, and build up our treasury in the process.

A few initiatives have been launched in light of this partnership:

* [CTDL-FRAX bond](../using-the-website/bonds/bond_ohm_frax.md)
* [FRAX bond](../using-the-website/bonds/bond_frax.md)
* Staking of CTDL-FRAX LP tokens \(deprecated\)
